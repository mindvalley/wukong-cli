<p align="center">A Swiss-army Knife CLI For Mindvalley Developers</p>

<p align="center">This is a <strong>Work In Progress ðŸš§</strong>.</p>

### The idea
The Wukong CLI is a set of tools to manages Mindvalley DevOps resources. Its goal is to provide a one-stop shop for developers to interact with the Mindvalley DevOps ecosystem. By centralizing different tasks on different tools into a single CLI, It will solve these problems when it comes to adopting DevOps practices:  
- Knowledge Gaps: Learning to use a new tool can be painful. Each tool has a unique UI & UX, as well as different workflows. 
- Getting Lost in the ecosystem: Itâ€™s completely normal for a company to have 20+ different DevOps tools, so knowing which tool to use and remember where to access it can be a problem. Afterall developers are having enough trouble dealing with their day to day tasks.

## Get Started
1. Make sure you have Rust installed. The recommanded way is to install Rustup, the Rust installer and version management tool:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
The you can check your rust version using:
```bash
rustc --version
# output
# rustc 1.61.0 (fe5b13d68 2022-05-18)
```
> **Note**
> `rustc` is rust compiler

2. Since this CLI is a binary program, you can use `cargo run` to start the program
> **Note**
> `cargo` is the Rust build tool and package manager

## Safety
This crate uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in **100% Safe Rust**.
